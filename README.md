# A real-time chat app with React, Node, Socket.io, and HarperDB

[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-realtime-chat-app-with-react-express-socketio-and-harperdb/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-realtime-chat-app-with-react-express-socketio-and-harperdb/)

In this app:

* **Frontend**: React (A frontend JavaScript framework for building interactive applications)

* **Backend**: Node and Express (Express is very popular NodeJS framework that allows us to easily create APIs and backends)

* **Database**: HarperDB (a data + application platform that allows you to query data using either SQL or NoSQL. HarperDB also has a built-in API, saving us from having to write a lot of backend code)

* **Realtime communication**: Socket.io
